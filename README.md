Web scraping selectors can be customized in `/src/app/api/scrape-job/route.ts` to support additional job portals.

### UI Customization

- Tailwind CSS configuration in `tailwind.config.ts`
- Custom styles in `/src/app/globals.css`
- Component styling in individual component files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Errors**

   - Ensure your Gemini API key is correctly set in `.env.local`
   - Verify the API key has proper permissions

2. **PDF Upload Issues**

   - Only PDF files are supported
   - Ensure file size is under 10MB
   - Check that the PDF contains extractable text

3. **Job Scraping Failures**

   - Some sites block scraping - use manual input
   - Check if the URL is publicly accessible
   - Try different job portal URLs

4. **Analysis Errors**
   - Ensure both resume and job description are provided
   - Check internet connection for AI API calls
   - Verify content isn't too long (10k character limit)

### Performance Optimization

- Large files are processed client-side before upload
- AI analysis is optimized for speed and accuracy
- Caching can be implemented for repeated analyses

## Setup Instructions

### Basic Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
   CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-claude-api-key (optional)
   ```
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

### Firebase Setup (for Portfolio Hosting)

To enable the portfolio hosting feature, you'll need to set up Firebase:

1. Create a Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable the following services:
   - Authentication (Email/Password and Google sign-in)
   - Firestore Database
   - Storage
3. Get your Firebase configuration from Project Settings > General > Your apps > SDK setup
4. Add the Firebase configuration to your `.env.local` file:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
   ```
5. Set up Firebase security rules for Firestore and Storage to secure your application

## How It Works

1. Users upload their resume
2. The app extracts key information from the resume
3. Users can enter a job description URL or paste the text
4. The AI analyzes the resume against the job description
5. Users get a matching score and suggestions for improvement
6. Users can generate a tailored portfolio and cover letter
7. Users can host their portfolio with a shareable link (requires Firebase setup)

## Portfolio Hosting Feature

The new portfolio hosting feature allows users to:

- Generate a professional portfolio from their resume
- Host the portfolio online with a unique URL
- Share the portfolio link with recruiters and on social media
- Authentication only required when hosting (not for resume analysis)
- View and manage all their hosted portfolios
